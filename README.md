### Project Title
Explore Bike Share Data

### Description
In this project, I will make use of R to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and making visualizations!
For this project, your goal is to ask and answer three questions about the available bikeshare data from Washington, Chicago, and New York.  This notebook can be submitted directly through the workspace when you are confident in your results.
